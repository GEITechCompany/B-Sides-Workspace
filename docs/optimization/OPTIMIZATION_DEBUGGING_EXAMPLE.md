# B-Sides Platform Optimization Debugging Example

I'm encountering errors while implementing optimizations for the B-Sides platform. Please help me diagnose and resolve these issues.

## Optimization Context

- **Optimization Type**: Lazy loading components for dashboard
- **Relevant Guide**: OPTIMIZATION_CHECKLIST.md (High Impact / Low Effort section)
- **Priority Level**: High (The dashboard is our most performance-critical page)

## Error Details

- **Error Message**: 
```
Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.

Check the render method of `DashboardPage`.
```

- **Error Location**: When loading the dashboard page after implementing dynamic imports
- **Console Output**: 
```
Warning: React.jsx: type is invalid -- expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.

## Implementation Details

### What I Was Trying to Optimize

I was trying to improve the dashboard load time by implementing lazy loading for several heavy components that aren't immediately visible to the user (charts, analytics widgets, etc.). The dashboard was taking over 2.5 seconds to become interactive, and we identified the large initial bundle as a key bottleneck.

### Changes Made

```jsx
// Original code in app/dashboard/page.tsx
import React from 'react'
import ProjectsWidget from '@/components/dashboard/ProjectsWidget'
import AnalyticsChart from '@/components/dashboard/AnalyticsChart'
import ActivityFeed from '@/components/dashboard/ActivityFeed'
import TeamPerformance from '@/components/dashboard/TeamPerformance'

export default function DashboardPage() {
  return (
    <div className="dashboard-container">
      <div className="dashboard-top-row">
        <ProjectsWidget />
        <AnalyticsChart />
      </div>
      <div className="dashboard-bottom-row">
        <ActivityFeed />
        <TeamPerformance />
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

// Modified code that caused the error
import React from 'react'
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'
import ProjectsWidget from '@/components/dashboard/ProjectsWidget'

const AnalyticsChart = dynamic(() => 
  import('@/components/dashboard/AnalyticsChart')
)
const ActivityFeed = dynamic(() => 
  import('@/components/dashboard/ActivityFeed')
)
const TeamPerformance = dynamic(() => 
  import('@/components/dashboard/TeamPerformance')
)

export default function DashboardPage() {
  return (
    <div className="dashboard-container">
      <div className="dashboard-top-row">
        <ProjectsWidget />
        <AnalyticsChart />
      </div>
      <div className="dashboard-bottom-row">
        <ActivityFeed />
        <TeamPerformance />
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Environment Information

- **Node.js Version**: v18.17.0
- **NPM Version**: npm 9.6.7
- **Next.js Version**: 14.0.3
- **Operating System**: macOS 14.1.1
- **Browser**: Chrome 119.0.6045.159

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies
2. Make the above changes to app/dashboard/page.tsx
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to the dashboard page (http://localhost:3000/dashboard)
5. The error appears in the browser with the page failing to render

## What I've Already Tried

- I've double-checked that all the component files exist and are properly exported
- I tried adding loading fallbacks to the dynamic imports
- I verified that the components work when imported normally
- I tried restarting the development server
- I tried using React.lazy() instead of Next.js dynamic import (got a different error about React.lazy not being supported in server components)

## Performance Impact

- **Before Optimization**: Initial page load: 2.5s, Bundle size: 1.2MB
- **Expected Improvement**: Reduce initial load to under 1s by deferring non-critical components
- **Current Result**: Page fails to load completely due to the error

## Additional Context

The components being lazy-loaded are fairly complex and have their own dependencies. The AnalyticsChart component in particular uses several third-party chart libraries that significantly contribute to the bundle size.

I'm not sure if the issue is related to Next.js server components, as I'm using the App Router architecture. It seems like the dynamic imports might not be compatible with server components.

## Specific Questions

1. What's causing this error with the dynamic imports?
2. How can I fix it while still achieving the code-splitting goal for the dashboard?
3. Are there alternative approaches to reducing the dashboard's initial bundle size in Next.js App Router?
4. How should I properly implement lazy loading in a Next.js 14 application with server components?

## Common Optimization Error Categories to Consider

### Bundle Size and Code Splitting Issues

- Dynamic import syntax errors
- Webpack configuration issues
- Tree-shaking failures
- Circular dependencies
