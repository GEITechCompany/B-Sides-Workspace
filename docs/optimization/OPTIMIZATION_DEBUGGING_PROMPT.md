- **Relevant Guide**: [Which guide were you following? e.g., PROJECT_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md, OPTIMIZATION_CHECKLIST.md]
- **Priority Level**: [High/Medium/Low]

## Error Details

- **Error Message**: 
```
[Paste the exact error message here]
```

- **Error Location**: [Where is the error occurring? e.g., "During build", "When lazy loading components", "When implementing database indexes"]
- **Console Output**: [Include any relevant console output, stack traces, or logs]
