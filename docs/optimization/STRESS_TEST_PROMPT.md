# B-Sides Platform Stress Test Prompt

I need to stress test the B-Sides platform to identify performance bottlenecks. Please help me develop a test plan.

## Test Areas
- [ ] Frontend (dashboard, projects, documents UI)
- [ ] API endpoints
- [ ] Database queries
- [ ] Supabase storage
- [ ] Authentication system

## Current & Target Metrics
- Current: [e.g., 50 concurrent users, 300ms response]
- Target: [e.g., 500 concurrent users, <500ms response]

## Questions
1. What tools work best for testing Next.js + Supabase?
2. How can I simulate realistic user behavior?
3. What metrics should I monitor?
4. How can I identify bottleneck locations?

## Request
Please provide basic test scripts and a monitoring approach.
