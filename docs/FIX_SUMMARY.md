# B-Sides Platform Fix Summary

This document summarizes the key fixes applied to the B-Sides platform to address various issues.

## 1. Documentation Organization and Link Fixes

### Issues Fixed
- Documentation files were scattered in the root directory
- Internal links between documentation files were broken after reorganization

### Solutions Applied
- Organized documentation into structured directories:
  - `docs/setup/` - Setup guides
  - `docs/database/` - Database documentation
  - `docs/debugging/` - Troubleshooting guides
  - `docs/optimization/` - Performance optimization
  - `docs/templates/` - Request templates
- Created a link verification script (`scripts/testing/fix-broken-links.js`) that:
  - Identifies broken links in documentation
  - Automatically fixes links to point to the correct new locations
  - Can be run with a `--fix` flag to apply changes automatically

### Benefits
- Improved organization and discoverability of documentation
- Reduced 404 errors when navigating between documents
- Easier maintenance with categorized documentation

## 2. "Next: Command Not Found" Error Fix

### Issue Fixed
- Development server wouldn't start due to the error: `sh: next: command not found`

### Solutions Applied
- Installed Next.js locally with the correct version: `npm install next@14.0.3 --save`
- Created a detailed troubleshooting guide with multiple solution options:
  - Local installation option
  - Using npx to run Next.js
  - Reinstalling dependencies
  - Checking node_modules/.bin directory
  - Using absolute paths in package.json scripts

### Benefits
- Development server now starts correctly
- Multiple solution options documented for different scenarios
- Prevention tips to avoid the issue in the future

## 3. Additional Resources Created

- **Link Verification Prompt**: Template for systematically checking links
- **Fix Broken Links Script**: Automated tool for discovering and fixing broken links
- **NEXT_COMMAND_ERROR_FIX.md**: Comprehensive guide for solving the Next.js command issue

## Running the Development Server

The Next.js development server now starts correctly and is accessible at http://localhost:3000.

## Future Maintenance Recommendations

1. **Link Management**:
   - Use relative links between documentation files in the same category
   - Use root-relative links (`/docs/category/file.md`) for cross-category references
   - Run the link verification script periodically to catch broken links

2. **Dependency Management**:
   - Verify that all dependencies are properly installed before starting development
   - Use explicit versions in package.json to ensure consistency

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - When adding new documentation, place it in the appropriate category directory
   - Update the README.md to reference new documentation
   - Follow the established naming conventions
